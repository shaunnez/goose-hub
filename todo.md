0. When a task gets blocked... i need some way of fixing it. Need to consider how i can send it back to the dev/qa/triage... Assuming i should be able to do this in the "transition" drop down. Ideally the banner shown "Human intervention reuqired" has a link or guidance... Lets plan it
0a. QA and Investigation section "rerun and other buttons"
1. Remove fake triage

# Todo
Invoke web standards [retrospectivesection, reviewsection, timelineevents] -- way to big. Interface should be in logical place (lib) and shared. 
Too many components and lines of code inside each of them, things could be split out into seperate files. 
Tests - whats level are we at seems low?
Loading ... should always be something inside timeline "agent run" window indicating it's loading. This is seen on code.
Timeline needs header like other pages. Put expand / collapse next to it.

# Retrospective  

  Review — holdout, per-PR, forward-looking. Input: issue body + PR diff. Question: did the code meet the spec? No access to agent reasoning by design.                              
                                                                                                                                                                                     
  Retro — per-run, backward-looking. Input: run_summary (outcome, decision summaries, retry count, QA fail flag) + trigger reasons. Question: how well did the agents perform?       
                                                
  The gap you identified is real. Retro currently only sees decision summaries — one-sentence self-reports the agents themselves wrote. It's meta-analysis of curated output, not raw
   log analysis. So it can catch things like "settings.json mutated out-of-scope" only because the reviewer emitted a decision summary saying exactly that. It cannot independently  
  discover things agents didn't report themselves.                                                                                                                                   
                                                
  Your vision (analyze raw logs → identify skill-level failure patterns → recommend/draft skill.md changes) is a meaningfully different and more powerful thing. What that would     
  require:
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  1. Raw event log access — retro would need the full agent.decision-summary event stream plus any agent.tool-call or agent.message events, not just the condensed run_summary       
  2. Skill file access — read current skills/<name>/skill.md to understand what the agent was instructed to do, compare against what it actually did
  3. Skill diff output — produce either a proposed patch to a skill file, or a registered issue with the proposed change                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  The current retro is more like a sprint retrospective (what went well/badly on this delivery). What you're describing is closer to agent coaching — reading the transcript,        
  comparing it to the playbook, and updating the playbook.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                     
  That's a strong milestone candidate. The current output (persona quality scores, improvement candidates) gives you the scaffolding — you'd extend the skill to accept raw events + 
  skill contents, and add a skillImprovementCandidates section to the schema alongside improvementCandidates.
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Worth filing as a separate issue, or do you want to scope it out now?
